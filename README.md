Alternative Android weather application for ilmatieteenlaitos.fi

Got fed up with the original Android app for ilmatieteenlaitos.fi? Here's a good alternative with rain maps, history graphs, 10 day forecasts and warnings, all presented in a very compact manner.

The directory included can be used as a project directory for Eclipse IDE (import existing projects into workspace). Android ADT plugin is also recommended.
